OARC has the goal of providing Rutgers researchers with essential computing and data handling capabilities, and students with necessary exposure and training, through centralized resources, services and training.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on OARC, including how to get access or become owners, please visit \nour web page\n\n\nThese pages are a collection of resources to help you to utilize the cluster more effectively. Even if you are a very experienced Linux user, you will want to read \nAmarel user guide\n as it has slurm tips and examples. \n\n\n\n\nFor users familiar with Linux but new to \nslurm\n, follow \nthis path\n\n\nFor users not familiar with Linux, please familiarize yourself with Linux through tutorials and cheatsheets",

Then from your terminal connect to the cluster by executing the following command: \n\n\nssh -X <your net id>@amarel.hpc.rutgers.edu\n \n\n   This is the preferred way, as your copy-pasting will most likely work best. \n\n\nvia FastX\n: in your browser, go to \nhttps://amarel.hpc.rutgers.edu:3443\n\n\n\n\nGet resources on the compute node\n\n\nYou get to the cluster to execute your computations by running the following command in your terminal:  \n\n\nsrun  -p main --reservation=genomics -N 1 -c 2 -n 1 -t 01:40:00 --export=ALL --pty /bin/bash\n \n\nNotice that the name in your terminal will change from \namarel\n to node name like \nhal0025\n or \nslepner086\n.

These are: \n\n\n\n\nyour home directory - \n/home/netid/\n  (e.g. \n/home/kp807/\n for my netid) -\n\n\nyour scratch directory - \n/scratch/netid/\n\n\n\n\nThey differ in how often they are backed up and by size (100Gb for \n/home\n and 500Gb for \n/scratch\n). So we will install programs in \n/home\n, while the data and output will be in \n/scratch\n. Execute these commands: \n\n\n                cd ~                      # change directory to your home directory\n                mkdir Genomics_Workshop\n                cd Genomics_Workshop\n                mkdir Programs            # download and install programs here\n\n\n\n\n                mkdir -p  /scratch/$USER/Genomics_Workshop/\n                cd /scratch/$USER/Genomics_Workshop/\n                mkdir untreated  \n                mkdir dex_treated\n\n\n\n\nInstall programs\n\n\nEach program will have slightly different installation instructions. Here is a handy sequence of commands that will install them: \n\n\n##We are going to do some modifications to a system file .bashrc, be careful doing it and make sure that you created a copy of your .bashrc file\n                cd\n                cp .bashrc .bashrc_20180118\n                nano .bashrc\n##At the end of the file add the line  \u201c##  Genomics_Workshop 06/27/2018 settings\u201d\n##Exit nano (ctrl+x)\n\n#Seqtk:   https://github.com/lh3/seqtk   ##  very handy and fast for processing fastq/a files\n                cd\n                cd Genomics_Workshop/Programs/\n                git clone https://github.com/lh3/seqtk.git \n                cd seqtk\n                make\n                echo \u2018export PATH=$HOME/Genomics_Workshop/Programs/seqtk:$PATH\u2019 >>  ~/.bashrc\n                source ~/.bashrc\n\n#sratoolkit     https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK158900/\n                        https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=software\n##for downloading and processing data from GEO/SRA database\n                cd\n                cd Genomics_Workshop/Programs/\n                wget http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/2.8.2/sratoolkit.2.8.2-centos_linux64.tar.gz\n                tar zxvf sratoolkit.2.8.2-centos_linux64.tar.gz\n                echo \u2018export PATH=$HOME/Genomics_Workshop/Programs/sratoolkit.2.8.2-centos_linux64/bin:$PATH\u2019 >> ~/.bashrc\n                source ~/.bashrc \n\n#htseq-count    http://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/master/install.html ##for counting the  reads mapped on to genomics feature\n\n                cd\n                module load intel/17.0.2 python/2.7.12\n                pip install HTSeq --user\n\n#fastQC          #widely used for sequencing read QC\n\n                cd\n                cd  Genomics_Workshop/Programs/\n                wget https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.6.zip\n                unzip  fastqc_v0.11.6.zip\n                echo \u2018export PATH=$HOME/Genomics_Workshop/Programs/FastQC:$PATH\u2019 >> ~/.bashrc\n                source ~/.bashrc\n\n\n#FASTX-toolkit    http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/   (##also a tool kit for fastq processing, quality trim, adaptor removal, etc. try if time allows)\n\n#RSeQC-2.6.4     ##An RNA-seq quality control package, multiple functions\n\n                cd\n                cd  Genomics_Workshop/Programs/\n                module load python/2.7.12\n                module load intel/17.0.2\n                pip install RSeQC --user\n\n\n#trimmomatic             ##for fastq quality trim and adaptor removal\n\n                cd\n                cd  Genomics_Workshop/Programs/\n                wget http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/Trimmomatic-0.36.zip\n                unzip Trimmomatic-0.36.zip \n                java -jar ~/Genomics_Workshop/Programs/Trimmomatic-0.36/trimmomatic-0.36.jar #-h                    \n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, execute the following commands to load system-installed sofware so the system knows where to find it (i.e. \nsamtools\n command will work if you execute \nmodule load samtools\n): \n\n\nmodule load samtools       \nmodule load bedtools2./2.25.0\nmodule load bowtie2\nmodule load mvapich2/2.1  boost/1.59.0  tophat2/2.1.0\nmodule load intel/17.0.4 R-Project/3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nDownload data\n\n\nWe will download human RNA-seq data with \nGEO accession GSE52778\n. The samples we download are in NCBI's short read archive format (SRA). To unpack the original sequence files can be a bit tricky at first. Please put them in different directories:\n\n\n                mkdir -p  /scratch/$USER/Genomics_Workshop/\n                cd /scratch/$USER/Genomics_Workshop/\n                mkdir untreated  \n                mkdir dex_treated\n\n\n\n\nWe will use sratoolkit programs to download data but first we need to configure a location where all data files will be stored. \nsratoolkit\n will be in your home directory, under \nPrograms\n, and the \nvdb-config\n might be under the \nbin\n directory. You will enter \n/scratch/your_netID/Genomics_Workshop/download\n for the path. \n\n\n                vdb-config   --interactive-mode textual     ### dash-dash before interactive-mode\n                         Your choice > 4\n## type new path\n                        /scratch/your_netID/Genomics_Workshop/download\n                        Your choice > Y\n\n\n\n\nThen execute the following commands to get the data. Both \nprefetch\n and \nfastq-dump\n are part of sratools. Downloading can take some time! [TODO: check how much time for these files!]\n\n\nprefetch -v SRR1039508\nfastq-dump --gzip --split-files SRR1039508\n\n\n\n\nThese two commands showed how to do it for one sample. You need to do it for 6 samples total.",
