OARC has the goal of providing Rutgers researchers with essential computing and data handling capabilities, and students with necessary exposure and training, through centralized resources, services and training.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on OARC, including how to get access or become owners, please visit \nour web page\n\n\nThese pages are a collection of resources to help you to utilize the cluster more effectively. Even if you are a very experienced Linux user, you will want to read \nAmarel user guide\n as it has slurm tips and examples. \n\n\n\n\nFor users familiar with Linux but new to \nslurm\n, follow \nthis path\n\n\nFor users not familiar with Linux, please familiarize yourself with Linux through tutorials and cheatsheets",

If you have Windows, install an SSH client such as \nputty\n or \nmoba-xterm\n. Then from your terminal connect to the cluster by executing the following command: \n\n\n\n\nssh -X <your net id>@amarel.hpc.rutgers.edu\n\n\nThis is the preferred way, as your copy-pasting will most likely work best. \n  - \nvia FastX\n: in your browser, go to \nhttps://amarel.hpc.rutgers.edu:3443\n\n\nGet resources on the compute node\n\n\nYou get to the cluster to execute your computations by running the following command in your terminal: \n\n\nsrun  -p main --reservation=genomics -N 1 -c 2 -n 1 -t 01:40:00 --export=ALL --pty /bin/bash\n\n\nNotice that the name in your terminal will change from \namarel\n to node name like \nhal0025\n or \nslepner086\n. This means that you will not impede other users who are also using the login node, and will be placed on a machine which you share with only a few people.

These are \n/home/netid/\n (e.g. \n/home/kp807/\n for my netid) and '/scratch/netid/'. They differ in how often they are backed up and by size (100Gb for \n/home\n and 500Gb for \n/scratch\n). So we will install programs in \n/home\n, while the data and output will be in \n/scratch\n. Execute these commands: \n\n\n                cd ~                      # change directory to your home directory\n                mkdir Genomics_Workshop\n                cd Genomics_Workshop\n                mkdir Programs            # download and install programs here\n\n\n\n\n                mkdir -p  /scratch/$USER/Genomics_Workshop/\n                cd /scratch/$USER/Genomics_Workshop/\n                mkdir untreated  \n                mkdir dex_treated\n\n\n\n\nInstall programs\n\n\nEach program will have slightly different installation instructions.
