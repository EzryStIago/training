OARC has the goal of providing Rutgers researchers with essential computing and data handling capabilities, and students with necessary exposure and training, through centralized resources, services and training.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on OARC, including how to get access or become owners, please visit \nour web page\n\n\nThese pages are a collection of resources to help you to utilize the cluster more effectively. Even if you are a very experienced Linux user, you will want to read \nAmarel user guide\n as it has slurm tips and examples. \n\n\n\n\nFor users familiar with Linux but new to \nslurm\n, follow \nthis path\n\n\nFor users not familiar with Linux, please familiarize yourself with Linux through tutorials and cheatsheets",
