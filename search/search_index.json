            "text": "General Information\n\n\nThere are several clusters administered by OARC. Each cluster is using the resource scheduler \nSlurm\n to allocate users the requested resources. \n\n\n\n\nAmarel\n - a general access cluster. \nRequest access\n or \nbecome an owner\n\n\nPerceval\n - similar to Amarel, but paid for, and to be used by exclusively by, NIH grants and grantees\n\n\nNM3\n - \nNewark Massive Memory Machine\n\n\nSirius\n - a single big machine with no resource scheduler, acts as a big desktop with multiple concurrent users\n\n\n\n\nCluster Resources\n\n\nAmarel\n\n\nAmarel is a CentOS 7 Linux compute cluster that is actively growing through the combination of separate computing clusters into a single, shared resource.\n\n\nAmarel includes the following hardware (this list may already be outdated since the cluster is actively growing):\n\n\n52 CPU-only nodes, each with 28 Xeon e5-2680v4 (Broadwell) cores + 128 GB RAM\n20 CPU-only nodes, each with 28 Xeon e5-2680v4 (Broadwell) cores + 256 GB RAM\n4 28-core e5-2680v4 nodes each with 2 x Nvidia Pascal P100 GPUs onboard\n2 high-memory nodes, each with 56 e7-4830v4 (Broadwell) cores + 1.5 TB RAM\n53 CPU-only nodes, each with 16 Intel Xeon e5-2670 (Sandy Bridge) cores + 128 GB RAM\n5 CPU-only nodes, each with 20 Intel Xeon e5-2670 (Ivy Bridge) cores + 128 GB RAM\n26 CPU-only nodes, each with 24 Intel Xeon e5-2670 (Haswell) cores + 128 GB RAM\n4 CPU-only nodes, each with 16 Intel Xeon e5-2680 (Broadwell) cores + 128 GB RAM\n3 12-core e5-2670 nodes with 8 Nvidia Tesla M2070 GPUs onboard\n2 28-core e5-2680 nodes with 4 Quadro M6000 GPUs onboard\n1 16-core e5-2670 node with 8 Xeon Phi 5110P accelerators onboard\n\n\n\n\nDefault run time = 2 hours in the 'main' partition\nMaximum run time = 3 days in the 'main' partition\n\n\nPerceval\n\n\nPerceval has the same setup as Amarel. The same file system is mounted on both clusters and changes made to the filesystem on one cluster will be reflected in the other cluster as well. \n\n\nPerceval includes the following hardware (this list may already be outdated since the cluster is actively growing):\n\n\n132 CPU-only nodes, each with 24 Intel Xeon E5-2680 cores + 128 GB RAM\n8 GPU nodes with 24 Intel Xeon E5-2680 cores + 128 GB RAM\n1 Large Memory node with 48 Intel Xeon E5-2680 cores + 1.5 TB RAM\n\n\nDefault run time = 2 hours for all partitions\nMaximum run time = 7 days in the 'main' partition, 2 days in the 'gpu' partition\n\n\nBasic operations - connecting and moving files\n\n\nConnecting to the cluster\n\n\n\n\nAmarel is currently accessed using a single hostname, \namarel.rutgers.edu\n\n\nPerceval is currently accessed using a single hostname, \nperceval.rutgers.edu\n\n\n\n\nFor the example purposes, we will assume you are connecting to Amarel. When you connect to this system, your log-in session (your Linux shell) will begin on one of multiple log-in nodes, named amarel1, amarel2, etc. So, while you are logged-in to Amarel, you will see \"amarel1\" or \"amarel2\" as the name of the machine you are using.\n\n\nssh [your NetID]@amarel.rutgers.edu\n\n\nIf you are connecting from a location outside the Rutgers campus network, you will need to first connect to the campus network using the Rutgers VPN (virtual private network) service. See \nhere\n for details.\n\n\nMoving files\n\n\nThere are many different ways to this: secure copy (scp), remote sync (rsync), an FTP client (FileZilla), etc. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re logged-in to a local workstation or laptop (not already logged-in to Amarel). To send files from your local system to your Amarel /home directory,\n\n\nscp file-1.txt file-2.txt [NetID]@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/[NetID]\n\n\nTo pull a file from your Amarel /home directory to your laptop (note the \u201c.\u201d at the end of this command),\n\n\nscp [NetID]@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/[NetID]/file-1.txt  .\n\n\nIf you want to copy an entire directory and its contents using scp, you\u2019ll need to \u201cpackage\u201d your directory into a single, compressed file before moving it:\n\n\ntar -czf my-directory.tar.gz my-directory\n\n\nAfter moving it, you can unpack that .tar.gz file to get your original directory and contents:\n\n\ntar -xzf my-directory.tar.gz\n\n\nA handy way to synchronize a local file or entire directory between your local workstation and the Amarel cluster is to use the rsync utility. First, let's sync a local (recently updated) directory with the same directory stored on Amarel:\n\n\nrsync -trlvpz work-dir gc563@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/gc563/work-dir\n\n\nIn this example, the rsync options I'm using are t (preserve modification times), r (recursive, sync all subdirectories), l (preserve symbolic links), v (verbose, show all details), p (preserve permissions), z (compress transferred data)\n\n\nTo sync a local directory with updated data from Amarel:\n\n\nrsync -trlvpz gc563@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/gc563/work-dir work-dir\n\n\nHere, we've simply reversed the order of the local and remote locations.\n\n\nFor added security, you can use SSH for the data transfer by adding the e option followed by the protocol name (ssh, in this case):\n\n\nrsync -trlvpze ssh gc563@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/gc563/work-dir work-dir\n\n\nOnDemand - GUI for the cluster\n\n\nFor users not familiar with Linux, there is an option to connect to the cluster via a web browser (either from campus or through VPN) until you get more confortable with Linux. Both connecting and moving files can be achieved through \nthis interface\n. However, you are strongly encouraged to get comfortable with Linux, as your productivity will soar and a GUI is never as flexible as a command line interface.  \n\n\nFunctionalities of OnDemand: \n\n\n\n\nfile upload\n\n\nfile editor\n\n\nlinux shell \n\n\nlaunch Jupyter notebook\n\n\nlaunch RStudio\n\n\ncompose slurm job from a template\n\n\nsubmit slurm job\n\n\nview job queue \n\n\n\n\nListing available resources\n\n\nBefore requesting resources (compute nodes), it\u2019s helpful to see what resources are available and what cluster partitions (job queues) to use for certain resources.\n\n\nExample of using the \nsinfo\n command:\n\n\nsinfo\n\nPARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST\nmain*        up 3-00:00:00      4 drain* hal[0050-0051,0055,0093]\nmain*        up 3-00:00:00      5  down* slepner[084-088]\nmain*        up 3-00:00:00      4  drain hal[0023,0025-0027]\nmain*        up 3-00:00:00     86    mix gpu[003-004,006],hal[0001-0008,0017-0018,0022,0024,0028-0032,0044-0047,0054,0056-0057,0062-0068,0073-0079,0081-0092,0094-0096],mem002,pascal[001-006],slepner[010-014,016,018-023,036,042-044,046,048,071,074,076,081-082]\nmain*        up 3-00:00:00     84  alloc gpu005,hal[0009-0016,0019-0021,0033-0043,0048-0049,0052-0053,0058-0061,0069-0072,0080],mem001,slepner[009,015,017,024-035,037-041,045,047,054-070,072-073,075,077-080,083]\nmain*        up 3-00:00:00      2   down gpu[001-002]\ngpu          up 3-00:00:00      8    mix gpu[003,006],pascal[001-006]\ngpu          up 3-00:00:00      1  alloc gpu005\ngpu          up 3-00:00:00      2   down gpu[001-002]\nphi          up 3-00:00:00      1    mix gpu004\nmem          up 3-00:00:00      1    mix mem002\nmem          up 3-00:00:00      1  alloc mem001\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding this output:\n\n\n\n\nThere are 4 basic partitions, main (traditional compute nodes, CPUs only), gpu (nodes with general-purpose GPU accelerators), mem (CPU-only nodes with 1.5 TB RAM), phi (CPU-only nodes with Xeon Phi coprocessors.\n\n\nThe upper limit for a job\u2019s run time is 3 days (72 hours).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllocated (alloc)\n\n\nnodes that are currently running jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed (mix)\n\n\nnodes have jobs using some, but not all, CPU cores onboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle\n\n\nnodes are currently available for new jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrained (drain, drng)\n\n\nnodes are not available for use and may be offline for maintenance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlepner, Norse Mythology\n\n\n\"Sleipnir\" 8-legged war horse (this made more sense when CPUs had 8 cores).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHal\n\n\nHal is a dependable member of the Discovery One crew who does an excellent job of following instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPascal\n\n\nFrench mathematician and the name of one of NVIDIA's GPU architectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUDA\n\n\nThis is the name of a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by Nvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading software modules\n\n\nWhen you first log-in, only basic system-wide tools are available automatically.

I plan to run my entire job from within my /scratch directory because that offers the best filesystem I/O performance.\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --partition=main             # Partition (job queue)\n#SBATCH --requeue                    # Return job to the queue if preempted\n#SBATCH --job-name=zipx001a          # Assign an short name to your job\n#SBATCH --nodes=1                    # Number of nodes you require\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1                   # Total # of tasks across all nodes\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1            # Cores per task (>1 if multithread tasks)\n#SBATCH --mem=2000                   # Real memory (RAM) required (MB)\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00              # Total run time limit (HH:MM:SS)\n#SBATCH --output=slurm.%N.%j.out     # STDOUT output file\n#SBATCH --error=slurm.%N.%j.err      # STDERR output file (optional)\n#SBATCH --export=ALL                 # Export you current env to the job env\n\ncd /scratch/[your NetID]\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load intel/16.0.3 fftw/3.3.1\n\nsrun /scratch/[your NetID]/zipper/2.4.1/bin/zipper < my-input-file.in\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding this job script:\n\n\n\n\nA job script contains the instructions for the SLURM workload manager (cluster job scheduler) to manage resource allocation, scheduling, and execution of your job.\n\n\nThe lines beginning with #SBATCH contain commands intended only for the workload manager.\n\n\nMy job will be assigned to the \u201cmain\u201d partition (job queue).\n\n\nIf this job is preempted, it will be returned to the job queue and will start again when required resources are available\n\n\nThis job will only use 1 CPU core and should not require much memory, so I have requested only 2 GB of RAM \u2014 it\u2019s a good practice to request only about 2 GB per core for any job unless you know that your job will require more than that.\n\n\nMy job will be terminated when the run time limit has been reached, even if the program I\u2019m running is not finished. It is not possible to extend this time after a job starts running.\n\n\nAny output that would normally go to the command line will be redirected into the output file I have specified, and that file will be named using the compute node name and the job ID number.\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to configure your environment as needed for running your application/executable. This usually means loading any needed modules before the step where you run your application/executable.\n\n\nHere\u2019s how to run a serial batch job, loading modules and using the \nsbatch\n command:\n\n\nsbatch my-job-script.sh\n  \n\n\nThe \nsbatch\n command reads the contents of your job script and forwards those instructions to the SLURM workload manager. Depending on the level of activity on the cluster, your job may wait in the job queue for minutes or hours before it begins running.\n\n\nRunning a parallel (multicore MPI) job\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a SLURM job script for a parallel job. See the previous (serial) example for some important details omitted here.\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --partition=main             # Partition (job queue)\n#SBATCH --requeue                    # Return job to the queue if preempted\n#SBATCH --job-name=zipx001a          # Assign an short name to your job\n#SBATCH --nodes=1                    # Number of nodes you require\n#SBATCH --ntasks=16                  # Total # of tasks across all nodes\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1            # Cores per task (>1 if multithread tasks)\n#SBATCH --mem=124000                 # Real memory (RAM) required (MB)\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00              # Total run time limit (HH:MM:SS)\n#SBATCH --output=slurm.%N.%j.out     # STDOUT output file\n#SBATCH --error=slurm.%N.%j.err      # STDERR output file (optional)\n#SBATCH --export=ALL                 # Export you current env to the job env\n\ncd /scratch/[your NetID]\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load intel/16.0.3 fftw/3.3.1 mvapich2/2.1\n\nsrun --mpi=pmi2 /scratch/[your NetID]/zipper/2.4.1/bin/zipper < my-input-file.in\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding this job script:\n\n\n\n\nThe srun command is used to coordinate communication among the parallel tasks of your job. You must specify how many tasks you will be using, and this number usually matches the \u2013ntasks value in your job\u2019s hardware allocation request.\n\n\nThis job will use 16 CPU cores and nearly 8 GB of RAM per core, so I have requested a total of 124 GB of RAM \u2014 it\u2019s a good practice to request only about 2 GB per core for any job unless you know that your job will require more than that.\n\n\nNote here that I\u2019m also loading the module for the parallel communication libraries (MPI libraries) needed by my parallel executable.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how to run a parallel batch job, loading modules and using the \nsbatch\n command:\n\n\nsbatch my-job-script.sh\n\n\nNote here that I\u2019m also loading the module for the parallel communication libraries (MPI libraries) needed by my parallel executable.\n\n\nHere\u2019s how to run a parallel batch job, loading modules and using the \nsbatch\n command:\n\n\nsbatch my-job-script.sh\n\n\nRunning array of jobs\n\n\nArray job is an approach to handle multiple jobs with single job script. Here is an example to submit 500 jobs with single job script. \n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=main             # Name of the partition\n#SBATCH --job-name=arrayjobs         # Name of the job\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1                   # Number of tasks\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1            # Number of CPUs per task\n#SBATCH --mem=1GB                    # Requested memory\n#SBATCH --array=0-499                # Array job will submit 500 jobs\n#SBATCH --time=00:10:00              # Total run time limit (HH:MM:SS)\n#SBATCH --output=slurm.%N.%j.out     # STDOUT file\n#SBATCH --error=slurm.%N.%j.err      # STDERR file \n\necho  -n \"Executing on the machine: \" \nhostname\necho \"Array Task ID : \" $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID \necho \" Random number : \" $RANDOM\n\n\n\n\nIn the above description, the line \n\n#SBATCH --array=0-499\n\nsubmits 500 jobs. \n\n\nThe \"%\" seperator is useful to limit the number of jobs in the queue at a any given time. For example, the following line would send a maximum of 100 jobs to the queue. \n\n\n#SBATCH --array=0-499%100\n\n\n\n\nIt is a good practice to populate the queue with less than 500 jobs at any given time. \n\n\nRunning an interactive job\n\n\nAn interactive job gives you an active connection to a compute node (or collection of compute nodes) where you will have a login shell and you can run commands directly on the command line. This can be useful for testing, short analysis tasks, computational steering, or for running GUI-based applications.\n\n\nWhen submitting an interactive job, you can request resources (single or multiple cores, memory, GPU nodes, etc.) just like you would in a batch job:\n\n\n[NetID@amarel1 ~]$ srun --partition=main --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem=2000 --time=00:30:00 --export=ALL --pty bash -i\n\nsrun: job 1365471 queued and waiting for resources\nsrun: job 1365471 has been allocated resources\n\n[NetID@slepner045 ~]$\n\n\n\n\nNotice that, when the interactive job is ready, the command prompt changes from NetID@amarel1 to NetID@slepner045. This change shows that I\u2019ve been automatically logged-in to slepner045 and I\u2019m now ready to run commands there. To exit this shell and return to the shell running on the amarel1 login node, type the exit command.\n\n\nMonitoring the status of jobs\n\n\n_\nThe simplest way to quickly check on the status of active jobs is by using the \nsqueue\n command:\n\n\nsqueue -u [your NetID]\n\n  JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER  ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n1633383      main   zipper    xx345   R       1:15      1 slepner36\n\n\n\n\nHere, the state of each job is typically listed as being either PD (pending), R (running), along with the amount of allocated time that has been used (DD-HH:MM:SS).\n\n\nFor summary accounting information (including jobs that have already completed), you can use the \nsacct\n command:\n\n\nsacct\n\n       JobID    JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode \n------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- \n1633383          zipper       main      statx         16    RUNNING      0:0\n\n\n\n\nHere, the state of each job is listed as being either PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, or FAILED.\n\n\nFor complete and detailed job info, you can use the \nscontrol show job [JobID]\n command:\n\n\nscontrol show job 244348\n\nJobId=244348 JobName=XIoT22\n   UserId=gc563(148267) GroupId=gc563(148267) MCS_label=N/A\n   Priority=5050 Nice=0 Account=oarc QOS=normal\n   JobState=RUNNING Reason=None Dependency=(null)\n   Requeue=1 Restarts=0 BatchFlag=1 Reboot=0 ExitCode=0:0\n   RunTime=1-04:07:40 TimeLimit=2-00:00:00 TimeMin=N/A\n   SubmitTime=2017-05-14T07:47:19 EligibleTime=2017-05-14T07:47:19\n   StartTime=2017-05-14T07:47:21 EndTime=2017-05-16T07:47:21 Deadline=N/A\n   PreemptTime=None SuspendTime=None SecsPreSuspend=0\n   Partition=main AllocNode:Sid=amarel1:22391\n   ReqNodeList=(null) ExcNodeList=(null)\n   NodeList=hal0053\n   BatchHost=hal0053\n   NumNodes=1 NumCPUs=28 NumTasks=28 CPUs/Task=1 ReqB:S:C:T=0:0:*:*\n   TRES=cpu=28,mem=124000M,node=1\n   Socks/Node=* NtasksPerN:B:S:C=0:0:*:* CoreSpec=*\n   MinCPUsNode=1 MinMemoryNode=124000M MinTmpDiskNode=0\n   Features=(null) Gres=(null) Reservation=(null)\n   OverSubscribe=OK Contiguous=0 Licenses=(null) Network=(null)\n   Command=/scratch/gc563/run.STMV.CPU.slurm\n   WorkDir=/scratch/gc563\n   StdErr=/scratch/gc563/slurm.%N.244348.out\n   StdIn=/dev/null\n   StdOut=/scratch/gc563/slurm.%N.244348.out\n   Power=\n\n\n\n\nIf your jobs have already completed (or have been terminated), you can see details about those jobs using the sacct command with your NetID and a start time for the list of jobs this command will produce.\n\n\nsacct --user=[NetID] --starttime=2018-07-03 --format=JobID,Partition,JobName,MaxRSS,NodeList,Elapsed,MaxDiskRead,MaxDiskWrite,State\n\n\nKilling/ cancelling/ terminating jobs\n\n\nTo terminate a job, regardless of whether it is running or just waiting in the job queue, use the scancel command and specify the JobID number of the job you wish to terminate:\n\n\nscancel 1633383\n\nA job can only be cancelled by the owner of that job. When you terminate a job, a message from the SLURM workload manager will be directed to STDERR and that message will look like this:\n\n\nslurmstepd: *** JOB 1633383 ON slepner036 CANCELLED AT 2016-10-04T15:38:07 ***\n\n\nInstalling your own software\n\n\nPackage management systems like yum or apt-get, which are used to install software in typical Linux systems, are not available to users of shared computing resources like Amarel. Thus, most packages need to be compiled from their source code and then installed. Further, most packages are generally configured to be installed in /usr or /opt, but these locations are inaccessible to (not writeable for) general users. Special care must be taken by users to ensure that the packages will be installed in their own /home directory (/home/[NetID]).\n\n\nAs an example, here are the steps for installing ZIPPER, a generic example package that doesn\u2019t actually exist:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload your software package. You can usually download a software package to your laptop, and then transfer the downloaded package to your /home/[NetID] directory on Amarel for installation. Alternatively, if you have the http or ftp address for the package, you can transfer that package directly to your home directory while logged-in to Amarel using the \nwget\n utility:\n\nwget http://www.zippersimxl.org/public/zipper/zipper-4.1.5.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnzip and unpack the .tar.gz (or .tgz) file. Most software packages are compressed in a .zip, .tar or .tar.gz file. You can use the tar utility to unpack the contents of these files:\n\n\ntar -zxf zipper-4.1.5.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the instructions for installing. Several packages come with an INSTALL or README script with instructions for setting up that package. Many will also explicitly include instructions on how to do so on a system where you do not have root access. Alternatively, the installation instructions may be posted on the website from which you downloaded the software.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  cd zipper-4.1.5 \n  less README\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad the required software modules for installation. Software packages generally have dependencies, i.e., they require other software packages in order to be installed. The README or INSTALL file will generally list these dependencies. Often, you can use the available modules to satisfy these dependencies. But sometimes, you may also need to install the dependencies for yourself. Here, we load the dependencies for ZIPPER:\n\n\nmodule load intel/16.0.3 mvapich2/2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform the installation. The next few steps vary widely but instructions almost always come with the downloaded source package. Guidance on the special arguments passed to the configure script is often available by running the \n./configure -\u2013help\n command. What you see below is just a typical example of special options that might be specified.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n./configure --prefix=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5 --disable-float --enable-mpi --without-x --disable-shared\nmake -j 4\nmake install\n\n\n\n\nSeveral packages are set up in a similar way, i.e., using configure, then make, and make install. Note the options provided to the configure script \u2013 these differ from package to package, and are documented as part of the setup instructions, but the prefix option is almost always supported. It specifies where the package will be installed. Unless this special argument is provided, the package will generally be installed to a location such as /usr/local or /opt, but users do not have write-access to those directories. So, here, I'm installing software in my /home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5 directory. The following directories are created after installation: \n\n      - \n/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/bin\n where executables will be placed\n      - \n/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/lib\n where library files will be placed\n      - \n/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/include\n where header files will be placed\n      - \n/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/share/man\n where documentation will be placed\n\n\n\n\nConfigure environment settings. The above bin, lib, include and share directories are generally not part of the shell environment, i.e., the shell and other programs don\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d about these directories. Therefore, the last step in the installation process is to add these directories to the shell environment:  \n\n\n\n\nexport PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/bin:$PATH\nexport C_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH\nexport CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nexport MANPATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/share/man:$MANPATH\n\n\n\n\nThese \nexport\n commands are standalone commands that change the shell environment, but these new settings are only valid for the current shell session. Rather than executing these commands for every shell session, they can be added to the end of your ~/.bashrc file which will result in those commands being executed every time you log-in to Amarel.\n\n\nSingularity\n\n\nSingularity\n is a Linux containerization tool suitable for HPC environments. It uses its own container format and also has features that enable importing Docker containers.\n\n\nDocker\n is a platform that employs features of the Linux kernel to run software in a container. The software housed in a Docker container is not standalone program but an entire OS distribution, or at least enough of the OS to enable the program to work. Docker can be thought of as somewhat like a software distribution mechanism like yum or apt. It also can be thought of as an expanded version of a chroot jail, or a reduced version of a virtual machine.\n\n\nImportant differences between Docker and Singularity:\n\n\n\n\nDocker and Singularity have their own container formats.\n\n\nDocker containers can be imported and run using Singularity.\n\n\nDocker containers usually run as root, which means you cannot run Docker on a  shared computing system (cluster).\n\n\nSingularity allows for containers that can be run as a regular user. How? When importing a Docker container, Singularity removes any elements which can only run as root. The resulting containers can be run using a regular user account.\n\n\n\n\nImporting a Docker image:\n\n\nIf you have a pre-built Docker container, you can use Singularity to convert this container to the Singularity format. Once that's done, you can upload your Singularity container to your storage space on Amarel and run jobs using that container.\n\n\nHere's an example. NOTE that most of these steps are performed on your local system, not while logged-in on Amarel.\n\n\nIf you need to use any of Amarel's filesystems inside your container, you will need to make sure the appropriate directories exist in your container so those filesystems can be mounted using those directories.\n\n\nStart your container (in this example we will use ubuntu:latest) and create directories for mounting /scratch/gc563 and /projects/oarc. Of course, you'll need to use directories that you can access on Amarel.\n\n\n$ sudo docker run -it ubuntu:latest bash  \nroot@11a87dkw8748:/# mkdir -p /scratch/gc563 /projects/oarc\n\n\n\n\nExporting your Docker image\n\n\nFind the name of your Docker image using the 'docker ps' command,\n\n\n$ sudo docker ps\nCONTAINER ID  IMAGE          COMMAND  CREATED        STATUS        NAMES\n11a87dkw8748  ubuntu:latest  \"bash\"   2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes  bendakaya_pakodi\n\n\n\n\nIn this example the name of the images is bendakaya_pakodi. Export this image to a tarball,  \n\n\n$ sudo docker export bendakaya_pakodi > ubuntu.tar\n\n\n\n\nConverting to a Singularity image\n\n\nYou will need to have Singularity installed on your local workstation/laptop to prepare your image. The 'create' and 'import' operations of Singularity require root privileges, which you do not have on Amarel.\n\n\nCreate an empty singularity image, and then import the exported docker image into it,  \n\n\n$ sudo singularity create ubuntu.img\nCreating a sparse image with a maximum size of 1024MiB...\nUsing given image size of 1024\nFormatting image (/sbin/mkfs.ext3)\nDone. Image can be found at: ubuntu.img\n$ sudo singularity import ubuntu.img ubuntu.tar\n\n\n\n\nUsing Singularity containers inside a SLURM job\n\n\nTransfer\n your new Singularity image to Amarel. The following steps are performed while logged-in to Amarel.\n\n\nYou can run any task/program inside the container by prefacing it with\n\n\nsingularity exec [your image name]\n \n\n\nHere is a simple example job script that executes commands inside a container,  \n\n\n#SBATCH --partition=main             # Partition (job queue)\n#SBATCH --job-name=sing2me           # Assign an short name to your job\n#SBATCH --nodes=1                    # Number of nodes you require\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1                   # Total # of tasks across all nodes\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1            # Cores per task (>1 if multithread tasks)\n#SBATCH --mem=4000                   # Real memory (RAM) required (MB)\n#SBATCH --time=00:30:00              # Total run time limit (HH:MM:SS)\n#SBATCH --output=slurm.%N.%j.out     # STDOUT output file\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load singularity/.2.5.1\n\n## Where am I running?\nsrun singularity exec ubuntu.img hostname\n\n## What is the current time and date?\nsrun singularity exec ubuntu.img date\n\n\n\n\nIf you created directories for any Amarel filesystems, you should find they are mounted inside your container,\n\n\nmount | grep gpfs\n/dev/scratch/gc563 on /scratch/gc563 type gpfs (rw,relatime)\n/dev/projects/oarc on /projects/oarc type gpfs (rw,relatime)\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: If your container mounts Amarel directories, software inside the container may be able to destroy data on these filesystems for which you have write permissions. Proceed with caution.\n\n\nTroubleshooting/ Common Problems\n\n\nFailure to load module dependencies/prerequisites:\n\n\n module load R-Project/3.4.1\nLmod has detected the following error:  These module(s) exist but cannot be loaded as requested: \"R-Project/3.4.1\"\nTry: \"module spider R-Project/3.4.1\" to see how to load the module(s).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis software module has a prerequisite module that must be loaded first. To find out what prerequisite module is required, use the 'module spider' command followed by the name of the module you're trying to load:  \n\n\nmodule spider R-Project/3.4.1\n    This module can only be loaded through the following modules:\n      intel/17.0.4\n    Help: \n      This module loads the installation R-Project 3.4.1 compiled with the Intel 17.0.4 compilers.\n\n\n\n\nAh-ha, it looks like the intel/17.0.4 module must be loaded before loading R-Project/3.4.1\n\n\nAcknowledging Amarel\n\n\nPlease reference OARC and the Amarel cluster in any research report, journal or publication that requires citation of an author's work.

To send files from your local system to your Amarel /home directory,  scp file-1.txt file-2.txt [NetID]@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/[NetID]  To pull a file from your Amarel /home directory to your laptop (note the \u201c.\u201d at the end of this command),  scp [NetID]@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/[NetID]/file-1.txt  .

First, let's sync a local (recently updated) directory with the same directory stored on Amarel:  rsync -trlvpz work-dir gc563@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/gc563/work-dir  In this example, the rsync options I'm using are t (preserve modification times), r (recursive, sync all subdirectories), l (preserve symbolic links), v (verbose, show all details), p (preserve permissions), z (compress transferred data)  To sync a local directory with updated data from Amarel:  rsync -trlvpz gc563@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/gc563/work-dir work-dir  Here, we've simply reversed the order of the local and remote locations.  For added security, you can use SSH for the data transfer by adding the e option followed by the protocol name (ssh, in this case):  rsync -trlvpze ssh gc563@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/gc563/work-dir work-dir",

The lines beginning with #SBATCH contain commands intended only for the workload manager.  My job will be assigned to the \u201cmain\u201d partition (job queue).  If this job is preempted, it will be returned to the job queue and will start again when required resources are available  This job will only use 1 CPU core and should not require much memory, so I have requested only 2 GB of RAM \u2014 it\u2019s a good practice to request only about 2 GB per core for any job unless you know that your job will require more than that.  My job will be terminated when the run time limit has been reached, even if the program I\u2019m running is not finished. It is not possible to extend this time after a job starts running.  Any output that would normally go to the command line will be redirected into the output file I have specified, and that file will be named using the compute node name and the job ID number.   Be sure to configure your environment as needed for running your application/executable. This usually means loading any needed modules before the step where you run your application/executable.  Here\u2019s how to run a serial batch job, loading modules and using the  sbatch  command:  sbatch my-job-script.sh     The  sbatch  command reads the contents of your job script and forwards those instructions to the SLURM workload manager.

            "text": "Package management systems like yum or apt-get, which are used to install software in typical Linux systems, are not available to users of shared computing resources like Amarel. Thus, most packages need to be compiled from their source code and then installed. Further, most packages are generally configured to be installed in /usr or /opt, but these locations are inaccessible to (not writeable for) general users. Special care must be taken by users to ensure that the packages will be installed in their own /home directory (/home/[NetID]).  As an example, here are the steps for installing ZIPPER, a generic example package that doesn\u2019t actually exist:    Download your software package. You can usually download a software package to your laptop, and then transfer the downloaded package to your /home/[NetID] directory on Amarel for installation. Alternatively, if you have the http or ftp address for the package, you can transfer that package directly to your home directory while logged-in to Amarel using the  wget  utility: wget http://www.zippersimxl.org/public/zipper/zipper-4.1.5.tar.gz    Unzip and unpack the .tar.gz (or .tgz) file. Most software packages are compressed in a .zip, .tar or .tar.gz file. You can use the tar utility to unpack the contents of these files:  tar -zxf zipper-4.1.5.tar.gz    Read the instructions for installing. Several packages come with an INSTALL or README script with instructions for setting up that package. Many will also explicitly include instructions on how to do so on a system where you do not have root access. Alternatively, the installation instructions may be posted on the website from which you downloaded the software.        cd zipper-4.1.5 \n  less README    Load the required software modules for installation. Software packages generally have dependencies, i.e., they require other software packages in order to be installed. The README or INSTALL file will generally list these dependencies. Often, you can use the available modules to satisfy these dependencies. But sometimes, you may also need to install the dependencies for yourself. Here, we load the dependencies for ZIPPER:  module load intel/16.0.3 mvapich2/2.1    Perform the installation. The next few steps vary widely but instructions almost always come with the downloaded source package. Guidance on the special arguments passed to the configure script is often available by running the  ./configure -\u2013help  command. What you see below is just a typical example of special options that might be specified.      ./configure --prefix=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5 --disable-float --enable-mpi --without-x --disable-shared\nmake -j 4\nmake install  Several packages are set up in a similar way, i.e., using configure, then make, and make install. Note the options provided to the configure script \u2013 these differ from package to package, and are documented as part of the setup instructions, but the prefix option is almost always supported. It specifies where the package will be installed. Unless this special argument is provided, the package will generally be installed to a location such as /usr/local or /opt, but users do not have write-access to those directories. So, here, I'm installing software in my /home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5 directory. The following directories are created after installation:  \n      -  /home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/bin  where executables will be placed\n      -  /home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/lib  where library files will be placed\n      -  /home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/include  where header files will be placed\n      -  /home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/share/man  where documentation will be placed   Configure environment settings. The above bin, lib, include and share directories are generally not part of the shell environment, i.e., the shell and other programs don\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d about these directories. Therefore, the last step in the installation process is to add these directories to the shell environment:     export PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/bin:$PATH\nexport C_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH\nexport CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nexport MANPATH=/home/[NetID]/zipper/4.1.5/share/man:$MANPATH  These  export  commands are standalone commands that change the shell environment, but these new settings are only valid for the current shell session. Rather than executing these commands for every shell session, they can be added to the end of your ~/.bashrc file which will result in those commands being executed every time you log-in to Amarel.",

In the example below, I'll demonstrate how I did this for my Amarel user account.\n\n\nFirst, I'll create a directory where I can store my locally-installed R packages. This can have any name and it can be located anywhere you have access:\n\n\nmkdir ~/my.R.libs\n\n\nNext, to ensure that my new private R packages directory is searched when I try to load a library that's installed there, I need to make an environment setting that will point R to the right location. I'll create a new file in my /home directory named .Renviron (note the leading \".\" in that name) and I'll add the following line to that file:\n\n\nexport R_LIBS=~/my.R.libs\n\nNow, every time I start any version of R, my ~/my.R.libs directory will be the first location to be searched when loading a library.\n\n\n Some important notes about installing packages:\n\n\nThere are a variety of different ways to install packages in R. The most straightforward way is to use the built-in 'install.packages()' function while R is running. Using this approach gives you the flexibility to install the latest version of a package or you can specify an older version of a package. To install a specifc version of a package, you'll need the URL (web address) for the tarball (\n.tar.gz or \n.tgz file) containing the source code for that version.\n\n\nFor example, I want to load the following list of packages, and I need the specifc versions listed here: 'kernlab' version 0.9-24 'ROCR' version 1.0.7 'class' version 7.3.14 'party' version 1.0.25 'e1071' version 1.6.7 'randomForest' version 4.6.12 I can use a web search to find the source tarballs for these packages. For example, to find 'kernlab' version 0.9-24, I search for \"kernlab\" and find the \nwebsite\n. At that site, I see that 0.9-25 is the current version (not what I want), but there is \"kernlab archive\" link there that takes me to a long list of previous versions. I see a link for version 0.9-24 there, so I copy that URL and use that URL in my install.packages() command:  \n\n\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/kernlab/kernlab_0.9-24.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\n\n\n\n\nThe other packages I need can be found in the same way. While installing them, I find that 'ROCR-1.0.7' requires 'gplots' and 'party-1.0-25' requires 6 other prerequisites. So, I have to also install those prerequisite packages. In the end, my install.packages() commands are as follows:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"gplots\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/ROCR_1.0-7.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/class_7.3-14.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"mvtnorm\",\"modeltools\",\"strucchange\",\"coin\",\"zoo\",\"sandwich\"), lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/party/party_1.0-25.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/e1071/e1071_1.6-7.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/randomForest/randomForest_4.6-12.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of my package installs have completed successfully, those packages can be loaded normally and they will be available every time I log-in to the cluster.\n\n\nInstalling your own build of R\n\n\nFor some users or groups, installing and customizing or even modifying the latest version (or a specific version) of R is necessary. For those users, I'll demonstrate how to install a version of R below.\n\n\nHere are the commands to use for installing R-3.4.4 from source:\n\n\nwget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.4.tar.gz\ntar -zxf R-3.4.4.tar.gz\ncd R-3.4.4\nmodule load gcc/5.4 java/1.8.0_161\n./configure --prefix=/home/gc563/R/3.4.4 --enable-java\nmake -j 4\nmake install\ncd ..\nrm -rf R-3.4.4*\n\n\n\n\nHere, I have loaded the GCC compiler suite and Java before installing R. This is an optional step and I did it because there might be specific tools I will use with R that require these extra software packages.\n\n\nWhen I configured my installation, I specified (with --prefix=) that I want R to be installed in my /home directory. I prefer to use a [package]/[version] structure because that enables easy organization of multiple verisons of any software package. It's a personal preference.\n\n\nAt the end of my install procedure, I remove the downloaded install package and tarball, just to tidy-up.\n\n\nSince I've installed R in my /home directory, I can add packages using the default library directory since that too will be in my /home directory.\n\n\nBefore using my new R installation, I'll need to set some environment variables and load needed modules (the same ones I used for building my R installation). This can be done from the command line (but the settings won't persist after you log-out) or by adding these commands to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file (so the settings will persist):\n\n\nmodule load gcc/5.4 java/1.8.0_161\nexport PATH=/home/gc563/R/3.4.4/bin:$PATH\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/home/gc563/R/3.4.4/lib64\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/gc563/R/3.4.4/lib64\nexport MANPATH=/home/gc563/R/3.4.4/share/man\n\n\n\n\nIf you're adding these lines to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file, log-out and log-in again, then verify that the settings are working:\n\n\n$ module list\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) gcc/5.4   2) java/1.8.0_161\n$ which R\n~/R/3.4.4/bin/R\n\n\n\n\nNow that my new R installation is setup, I can begin adding R packages. Since this is my own installation of R and not one of the preinstalled versions available on the cluster, my default packages/libraries directory is /home/gc563/R/3.4.4/lib64/R/library  \n\n\n> .libPaths()  \n[1] \"/home/gc563/R/3.4.4/lib64/R/library\"\n\n\n\n\nInstall a package:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"rJava\")\nlibrary(rJava)\n\n\n\n\nSaving figures/ plots from R (without a display):\n\nNeed to save a PDF, PostScript, SVG, PNG, JPG, or TIFF file in your working directory? Normally, writing a graphics file from R requires a display of some kind and the X11 protocol. That's often not convenient for batch jobs running on the cluster. Alternatively, you can use the Cairo graphics device/library for R. Cairo enables you to write bitmap or vector graphics directly to a file. Here's an example:\n\n\n$ R --no-save\npng('my-figure.png', type='cairo')\nplot(rnorm(10),rnorm(10))\ndev.off()\nq()\n\n\n\n\nUsing Python\n\n\nGenerally, there are 2 approaches for using Python and its associated tools: (1) use one of the pre-installed Python modules (version 2.7.x or 3.5.x) which come bundled with a very broad range of common and useful tools (you can add or update packages if needed) or (2) install your own custom build of Python in your /home directory or in a shared directory (e.g., /projects/[group] or /projects/community).\n\n\nQuickstart\n\n\nmodule load intel_mkl/17.0.2 python/3.5.2 #loads libraries for underlying c/c++/fortran code first, needed for numpy.\n# OR\nmodule use /projects/community/modulefiles     # community software\nmodule load py-data-science-stack/5.1.0-kp807  # anaconda 5.1.0; various conda environments\n\n\n\n\nUsing pre-installed Python modules\n\n\nWith the pre-installed Python modules, you can add or update Python modules/packages as needed if you do it using the '--user' option for pip. This option will instruct pip to install new software or upgrades in your ~/.local directory. Here's an example where I'm installing the Django package:\n\n\nmodule load python/3.5.2\npip install --user Django\n\n\n\n\nNote: if necessary, pip can also be upgraded when using a system-installed build of Python, but be aware that the upgraded version of pip will be installed in ~/.local/bin. Whenever a system-installed Pytyon module is loaded, the PATH location of that module's executables (like pip) will precede your ~/.local/bin directory. To run the upgraded version of pip, you'll need to specify its location because the previous version of pip will no longer work properly:\n\n\n$ which pip\n/opt/sw/packages/gcc-4.8/python/3.5.2/bin/pip\n$ pip --version\npip 9.0.3 from /opt/sw/packages/gcc-4.8/python/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)\n$ pip install -U --user pip\nSuccessfully installed pip-10.0.1\n$ which pip\n/opt/sw/packages/gcc-4.8/python/3.5.2/bin/pip\n$ pip --version\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/opt/sw/packages/gcc-4.8/python/3.5.2/bin/pip\", line 7, in \n    from pip import main\nImportError: cannot import name 'main'\n\n$ .local/bin/pip --version\npip 10.0.1 from /home/gc563/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pip (python 3.5)\n$ .local/bin/pip install --user Django\n\n\n\n\nBuilding your own Python installation\n\n\nUsing this approach, I must specify that I want Python to be installed in my /home directory. This is done using the '--prefix=' option. Also, I prefer to use a [package]/[version] naming scheme because that enables easy organization of multiple verisons of Python (optional, it's just a personal preference).\n\nAt the end of my install procedure, I remove the downloaded install package and tarball, just to tidy-up.\n\n\nwget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/Python-3.6.5.tgz\ntar -zxf Python-3.6.5.tgz\ncd Python-3.6.5\n./configure --prefix=/home/gc563/python/3.6.5\nmake -j 4\nmake install\ncd ..\nrm -rf Python-3.6.5*\n\n\n\n\nBefore using my new Python installation, I'll need to set or edit some environment variables. This can be done from the command line (but the settings won't persist after you log-out) or by adding these commands to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file (so the settings will persist):\n\n\nexport PATH=/home/gc563/python/3.6.5/bin:$PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/gc563/python/3.6.5/lib\nexport MANPATH=/home/gc563/python/3.6.5/share/man\n\n\n\n\nIf you're adding these lines to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file, log-out and log-in again, then verify that the settings are working:\n\n\nwhich python3  \n~/python/3.6.5/bin\n\n\nRunning GROMACS\n\n\nHere is a simple example procedure that demonstrates how to use GROMACS 2016 on Amarel. In this example, we\u2019ll start with a downloaded PDB file and proceed through importing that file into GROMACS, solvating the protein, a quick energy minimization, and then an MD equilibration. This example is not intended to teach anyone how to use GROMACS. Instead, it is intended to assist new GROMACS users in learning to use GROMACS on Amarel.  \n\n\n\n\nDownload a PDB file.\n\n\nwget https://files.rcsb.org/view/5EWT.pdb\n  \n\n\nLoad the GROMACS software module plus any needed prerequisites.\n\n\nmodule purge  \n    module load intel/17.0.1 mvapich2/2.2 gromacs/2016.1\n\n\nImport the PDB into GROMACS, while defining the force field and water model to be used for this system.\n\n\ngmx_mpi pdb2gmx -f 5EWT.pdb -ff charmm27 -water tip3p -ignh -o 5EWT.gro -p 5EWT.top -i 5EWT.itp\n \n\n\nIncrease the size of the unit cell to accommodate a reasonable volume of solvent around the protein.\n\n\ngmx_mpi editconf -f 5EWT.gro -o 5EWT_newbox.gro -box 10 10 10 -center 5 5 5\n\n\nNow add water molecules into the empty space in the unit cell to solvate the protein.\n\n\ngmx_mpi solvate -cp 5EWT_newbox.gro -p 5EWT.top -o 5EWT_solv.gro\n\n\nPrepare your SLURM job script(s). The 2 \nmdrun\n commands in the following steps can be executed from within an interactive session or they can be run in batch mode using job scripts. If your mdrun commands/job might take more than a few minutes to run, it would be best to run them in batch mode using a job script. Here\u2019s an example job script for a GROMACS MD simulation. To run the 2 \nmdrun\n commands below, simply replace the example \nmdrun\n command in this script with one of the mdrun commands from the steps below and submit that job after preparing the simulation with the appropriate \ngrompp\n step.\n\n\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=main                # Partition (job queue)\n#SBATCH --job-name=gmdrun               # Assign an 8-character name to your job\n#SBATCH --nodes=1                       # Number of nodes\n#SBATCH --ntasks=16                     # Total # of tasks across all nodes\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1               # Threads per process (or per core)\n#SBATCH --mem=124000                    # Memory per node (MB)\n#SBATCH --time=00:20:00                 # Total run time limit (HH:MM:SS)\n#SBATCH --output=slurm.%N.%j.out        # combined STDOUT and STDERR output file\n#SBATCH --export=ALL                    # Export you current env to the job env\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load intel/17.0.1 mvapich2/2.2 gromacs/2016.1\nsrun --mpi=pmi2 gmx_mpi mdrun -v -s 5EWT_solv_prod.tpr \\\n                -o 5EWT_solv_prod.trr -c 5EWT_solv_prod.gro \\\n                -e 5EWT_solv_prod.edr -g 5EWT_solv_prod.md.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform an inital, quick energy minimization. Here, we\u2019re using a customized MD parameters file named em.mdp, which contains these instructions:\n\n\n\n\nintegrator     = steep\nnsteps         = 200\ncutoff-scheme  = Verlet\ncoulombtype    = PME\npbc            = xyz\nemtol          = 100\n\n\n\n\nThese are the commands (both the grompp step and the mdrun step) used to prepare and run the minimization:  \n\n\ngmx_mpi grompp -f em.mdp -c 5EWT_solv.gro -p 5EWT.top -o 5EWT_solv_mini.tpr -po 5EWT_solv_mini.mdp\n\ngmx_mpi mdrun -v -s 5EWT_solv_mini.tpr -o 5EWT_solv_mini.trr -c 5EWT_solv_mini.gro -e 5EWT_solv_mini.edr -g 5EWT_solv_mini.md.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform a quick MD equilibration (same syntax/commands for a regular MD run). Here, we\u2019re using a customized MD parameters file named equil.mdp, which contains these instructions:\n\n\n\n\nintegrator               = md\ndt                       = 0.002\nnsteps                   = 5000\nnstlog                   = 50\nnstenergy                = 50\nnstxout                  = 50\ncontinuation             = yes\nconstraints              = all-bonds\nconstraint-algorithm     = lincs\ncutoff-scheme            = Verlet\ncoulombtype              = PME\nrcoulomb                 = 1.0\nvdwtype                  = Cut-off\nrvdw                     = 1.0\nDispCorr                 = EnerPres\ntcoupl                   = V-rescale\ntc-grps                  = Protein  SOL\ntau-t                    = 0.1      0.1\nref-t                    = 300      300\npcoupl                   = Parrinello-Rahman\ntau-p                    = 2.0\ncompressibility          = 4.5e-5\nref-p                    = 1.0\n\n\n\n\nThese are the commands (both the grompp step and the mdrun step) used to prepare and run the equilibration:\n\n\ngmx_mpi grompp -f equil.mdp -c 5EWT_solv_mini.gro -p 5EWT.top -o 5EWT_solv_equil.tpr -po 5EWT_solv_equil.mdp\n\ngmx_mpi mdrun -v -s 5EWT_solv_equil.tpr -o 5EWT_solv_equil.trr -c 5EWT_solv_equil.gro -e 5EWT_solv_equil.edr -g 5EWT_solv_equil.md.log\n\n\n\n\nRunning TensorFlow with a GPU\n\n\nTensorFlow has two versions of its python package: \ntensorflow\n and \ntensorflow-gpu\n, but confusingly the command to use it is the same in both cases: \nimport tensorflow as tf\n  (and not \nimport tensorflow-gpu as tf\n in case of the GPU version). This means that it really matters which package is installed in your environment. \n\n\n\n\nyou can control your environment using Singularity image (but the problem arises if you need a package not included in the prebuilt image, in which case you need to build the image yourself)\n\n\nyou can control your environment using conda environments (or virtual-env). \n\n\n\n\nUsing Singularity\n\n\nTo do this, you can use the \nSingularity\n container manager and a Docker image containing the TensorFlow software. \n\n\nRunning Singularity can be done in batch mode using a job script. Below is an example job script for this purpose (for this example, we'll name this script \nTF_gpu.sh\n)\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --partition=main             # Partition (job queue)\n#SBATCH --no-requeue                 # Do not re-run job  if preempted\n#SBATCH --job-name=TF_gpu            # Assign an short name to your job\n#SBATCH --nodes=1                    # Number of nodes you require\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1                   # Total # of tasks across all nodes\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2            # Cores per task (>1 if multithread tasks)\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1                 # Number of GPUs\n#SBATCH --mem=16000                  # Real memory (RAM) required (MB)\n#SBATCH --time=00:30:00              # Total run time limit (HH:MM:SS)\n#SBATCH --output=slurm.%N.%j.out     # STDOUT output file\n#SBATCH --error=slurm.%N.%j.err      # STDERR output file (optional)\n#SBATCH --export=ALL                 # Export you current env to the job env\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load singularity/.2.5.1\n\nsrun singularity exec --nv docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:1.4.1-gpu python \n\n\n\n\nOnce your job script is ready, submit it using the sbatch command:\n\n\n$ sbatch TF_gpu.sh\n\nAlternatively, you can run Singularity interactively:\n\n\n$ srun --pty -p main --gres=gpu:1 --time=15:00 --mem=6G singularity shell --nv docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:1.4.1-gpu\n\nDocker image path: index.docker.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:1.4.1-gpu\nCache folder set to /home/user/.singularity/docker\nCreating container runtime...\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:054be6183d067af1af06196d7123f7dd0b67f7157a0959bd857ad73046c3be9a.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:779578d7ea6e8cc3934791724d28c56bbfc8b1a99e26236e7bf53350ed839b98.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:82315138c8bd2f784643520005a8974552aaeaaf9ce365faea4e50554cf1bb44.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:88dc0000f5c4a5feee72bae2c1998412a4b06a36099da354f4f97bdc8f48d0ed.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:79f59e52a355a539af4e15ec0241dffaee6400ce5de828b372d06c625285fd77.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:ecc723991ca554289282618d4e422a29fa96bd2c57d8d9ef16508a549f108316.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:d0e0931cb377863a3dbadd0328a1f637387057321adecce2c47c2d54affc30f2.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:f7899094c6d8f09b5ac7735b109d7538f5214f1f98d7ded5756ee1cff6aa23dd.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:ecba77e23ded968b9b2bed496185bfa29f46c6d85b5ea68e23a54a505acb81a3.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:037240df6b3d47778a353e74703c6ecddbcca4d4d7198eda77f2024f97fc8c3d.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/docker/sha256:b1330cb3fb4a5fe93317aa70df2d6b98ac3ec1d143d20030c32f56fc49b013a8.tar.gz\nImporting: /home/user/.singularity/metadata/sha256:b71a53c1f358230f98f25b41ec62ad5c4ba0b9d986bbb4fb15211f24c386780f.tar.gz\nSingularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...\n\nSingularity tensorflow:latest-gpu:~> \n\n\n\n\nNow, you're ready to execute commands:\n\n\n\nSingularity tensorflow:latest-gpu:~> python -V\nPython 2.7.12\nSingularity tensorflow:latest-gpu:~> python3 -V\nPython 3.5.2\n\n\n\n\nPlease remember to exit from your interactive job after you are finished with your calculations.  \n\n\nThere are several Docker images available on Amarel for use with Singularity. The one used in the example above, tensorflow:1.4.1-gpu, is intended for python 2.7.12. If you want to use Python3, you'll need a different image, docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:1.4.1-gpu-py3, and the Python command will be \npython3\n instead of \npython\n in your script.\n\n\nUsing conda\n\n\nYou can either install your own version of Anaconda in your home directory, or you can use a community module. \n\n\nmodule use /projects/community/modulefiles  #loads community-contributed software packages\nmodule keyword anaconda                     #search packages with 'anaconda' in description \n\n\n\n\noutput: \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe following modules match your search criteria: \"anaconda\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  py-data-science-stack: py-data-science-stack/5.1.0-kp807\n    Sets up anaconda 5.1.0 in your environment\n\n\n\n\nSo here are commands with which you can load tensorflow package: \n\n\nmodule load py-data-science-stack/5.1.0-kp807\nconda env list                                 # be patient\nsource activate tensorflow-gpu-1.7.0           #\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you try to import tensorflow on a node without a gpu, the import will fail, because it will try to load cuda driver that is not installed (because there is no GPU on the machine). \nSo you need to include this line in a slurm script, where you request a GPU resource in slurm: \n\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1\n and \n--partition=gpu\n and perhaps \n--constraint=pascal\n. Here is an example of a slurm script that trains mnist: \n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --partition=gpu             # Partition (job queue)\n#SBATCH --no-requeue                 # Do not re-run job  if preempted\n#SBATCH --job-name=mnist_p100            # Assign an short name to your job\n#SBATCH --nodes=1                    # Number of nodes you require\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1                   # Total # of tasks across all nodes\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1                 # Number of GPUs\n#SBATCH --constraint=pascal          # will look for that architecture\n#SBATCH --mem=6000                  # Real memory (RAM) required (MB)\n#SBATCH --time=03:30:00              # Total run time limit (HH:MM:SS)\n#SBATCH --output=slurm.%N.%j.p100_gpu1.out     # STDOUT output file\n#SBATCH --error=slurm.%N.%j.p100_gpu1.err      # STDERR output file (optional)\n#SBATCH --export=ALL                 # Export you current env to the job env\n\nmodule purge\n\nmodule use /projects/community/modulefiles\nmodule load py-data-science-stack/5.1.0-kp807\n\nsource activate tensorflow-gpu-1.7.0\n\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/kp807/tf/models1.7     #mnist.py needs a package defined in the tensorflow/models, not a standard distribution of TF. \n\nsrun python /home/kp807/tf/benchmarking/mnist.py",

It's very common for uers to need additional or custom packages for a base R installation. On a large, shared computing system, users are unable to install (write) to the usual places where R places new packages by default (/usr/local or /usr/lib). Therefore, managing your own local package/library installation location is necessary. In the example below, I'll demonstrate how I did this for my Amarel user account.  First, I'll create a directory where I can store my locally-installed R packages. This can have any name and it can be located anywhere you have access:  mkdir ~/my.R.libs  Next, to ensure that my new private R packages directory is searched when I try to load a library that's installed there, I need to make an environment setting that will point R to the right location. I'll create a new file in my /home directory named .Renviron (note the leading \".\" in that name) and I'll add the following line to that file:  export R_LIBS=~/my.R.libs \nNow, every time I start any version of R, my ~/my.R.libs directory will be the first location to be searched when loading a library.   Some important notes about installing packages:  There are a variety of different ways to install packages in R. The most straightforward way is to use the built-in 'install.packages()' function while R is running. Using this approach gives you the flexibility to install the latest version of a package or you can specify an older version of a package. To install a specifc version of a package, you'll need the URL (web address) for the tarball ( .tar.gz or  .tgz file) containing the source code for that version.  For example, I want to load the following list of packages, and I need the specifc versions listed here: 'kernlab' version 0.9-24 'ROCR' version 1.0.7 'class' version 7.3.14 'party' version 1.0.25 'e1071' version 1.6.7 'randomForest' version 4.6.12 I can use a web search to find the source tarballs for these packages. For example, to find 'kernlab' version 0.9-24, I search for \"kernlab\" and find the  website . At that site, I see that 0.9-25 is the current version (not what I want), but there is \"kernlab archive\" link there that takes me to a long list of previous versions. I see a link for version 0.9-24 there, so I copy that URL and use that URL in my install.packages() command:    install.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/kernlab/kernlab_0.9-24.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")  The other packages I need can be found in the same way. While installing them, I find that 'ROCR-1.0.7' requires 'gplots' and 'party-1.0-25' requires 6 other prerequisites. So, I have to also install those prerequisite packages. In the end, my install.packages() commands are as follows:  install.packages(\"gplots\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/ROCR_1.0-7.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/class_7.3-14.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"mvtnorm\",\"modeltools\",\"strucchange\",\"coin\",\"zoo\",\"sandwich\"), lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/party/party_1.0-25.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/e1071/e1071_1.6-7.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")\ninstall.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/randomForest/randomForest_4.6-12.tar.gz\", lib=\"~/my.R.libs\")  Once all of my package installs have completed successfully, those packages can be loaded normally and they will be available every time I log-in to the cluster.",

This is an optional step and I did it because there might be specific tools I will use with R that require these extra software packages.  When I configured my installation, I specified (with --prefix=) that I want R to be installed in my /home directory. I prefer to use a [package]/[version] structure because that enables easy organization of multiple verisons of any software package. It's a personal preference.  At the end of my install procedure, I remove the downloaded install package and tarball, just to tidy-up.  Since I've installed R in my /home directory, I can add packages using the default library directory since that too will be in my /home directory.  Before using my new R installation, I'll need to set some environment variables and load needed modules (the same ones I used for building my R installation). This can be done from the command line (but the settings won't persist after you log-out) or by adding these commands to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file (so the settings will persist):  module load gcc/5.4 java/1.8.0_161\nexport PATH=/home/gc563/R/3.4.4/bin:$PATH\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/home/gc563/R/3.4.4/lib64\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/gc563/R/3.4.4/lib64\nexport MANPATH=/home/gc563/R/3.4.4/share/man  If you're adding these lines to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file, log-out and log-in again, then verify that the settings are working:  $ module list\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) gcc/5.4   2) java/1.8.0_161\n$ which R\n~/R/3.4.4/bin/R  Now that my new R installation is setup, I can begin adding R packages.

Normally, writing a graphics file from R requires a display of some kind and the X11 protocol. That's often not convenient for batch jobs running on the cluster.

This file must include your contact info and any useful information about the software. This file should include all commands used to build the package since this information is important for anyone wishing to use contributed software for research purposes.\n\n\nThere is a long but useful example README.OARC file in \n/projects/community/gcc/7.3.0/gc563\n\n\n(2) All contributed software packages MUST have an associated \nLmod modulefile\n so users can easily access the software. There are details for doing this and examples below.\n\n\nAn Example: GCC-7.3.0\n\n\nMarch 23, 2018: I want to build GCC, The GNU Compiler Collection, version 7.3.0 since a project I'm working on requires it, but GCC-7.3.0 is not already setup on Amarel. I'll begin by \"bootstrapping\" using the core/default tools that come with the version of CentOS installed on Amarel. That version (at the time of this writing) is\n\n\n$ cat /etc/*release | head -n 1\nCentOS Linux release 7.4.1708 (Core)\n\n\n\n\nplus the additional components and tools that come from the Enterprise Linux repository. This version of CentOS is based on the following kernel and GCC version:\n\n\n$ cat /proc/version\nLinux version 3.10.0-693.21.1.el7.x86_64 (builder@kbuilder.dev.centos.org) (gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16) (GCC) ) #1 SMP Wed Mar 7 19:03:37 UTC 2018\n\n\n\n\nInstalling GCC requires a few prerequisite packages: these must be installed and configured for use before installing GCC. Those prerequisites are: GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP) version 4.3.2 (or later) MPFR Library version 2.4.2 (or later) MPC Library version 0.8.1 (or later) I'll download, test, and install a recent version of each of these software packages. Since I'm just trying to get setup for installing GCC here, I'll skip the description of these steps because I'll discuss those steps in detail later (below).\n\n\nwget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.bz2\ntar -jxf gmp-6.1.2.tar.bz2\n./configure --prefix=/projects/community/gmp/6.1.2/gc563 --enable-cxx --enable-fft\nmake -j 4\nmake check\nmake install\ncd .. ; rm -rf gmp-6.1.2*\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n the following environment settings are needed for installing the next package. These environment settings have not yet been set for my shell session, so that's why I'm not prepending them to existing path settings here:\n\n\nexport C_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/gc563/gmp/6.1.2/include\nexport CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/projects/community/gmp/6.1.2/gc563/include\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/projects/community/gmp/6.1.2/gc563/lib\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/projects/community/gmp/6.1.2/gc563/lib\n\n\n\n\nwget http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr-4.0.1.tar.bz2\ntar -jxf mpfr-4.0.1.tar.bz2 \ncd mpfr-4.0.1\n./configure --prefix=/projects/community/mpfr/4.0.1/gc563 --enable-thread-safe\nmake -j 4\nmake install\ncd .. ; rm -rf mpfr-4.0.1*\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n the following environment settings have already been set, so that's why I'm prepending additional segments to existing path settings here:\n\n\nexport C_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/gc563/mpfr/4.0.1/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH\nexport CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/projects/community/mpfr/4.0.1/gc563/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/projects/community/mpfr/4.0.1/gc563/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/projects/community/mpfr/4.0.1/gc563/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n\n\n\nwget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/mpc-1.1.0.tar.gz\ntar -zxf mpc-1.1.0.tar.gz\ncd mpc-1.1.0\n./configure --prefix=/projects/community/mpc/1.1.0/gc563\nmake\nmake install\ncd .. ; rm -rf mpc-1.1.0*\n\n\n\n\nexport C_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/gc563/mpc/1.1.0/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH\nexport CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/projects/community/mpc/1.1.0/gc563/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/projects/community/mpc/1.1.0/gc563/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/projects/community/mpc/1.1.0/gc563/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n\n\n\nNow, I can finally start building GCC. I'll download the latest stable supported release of GCC, open the tarball, and get ready to install it:\n\n\nwget http://mirrors.concertpass.com/gcc/releases/gcc-7.3.0/gcc-7.3.0.tar.gz\ntar -zxf gcc-7.3.0.tar.gz\ncd gcc-7.3.0\n\n\n\n\nLike the 3 prerequisite software packages I just installed, the GCC compiler suite uses the traditional configure/make/make-install installation procedure. The first step is to run the Bash script named 'configure'. The configure script inspects the existing hardware and/or software configuration of the machine where you are about to install this new software. If something is needed and missing (e.g., a needed library or access to specific tools), the configure script should let you know. The result of running this script is the creation of a file named 'Makefile' that contains the instructions for compiling your new software based on the findings from the configure script. In addition, when you run the configure script, you have the opportunity to select important options for how your new software will be setup. Most importantly, you can select where the software will be installed. This is accomplished using the '--prefix=[some location]' option. In my case, I'll specify a location in my /home directory. There are many other options and those options vary depending on what you're installing. To see a summary of the available options, use './configure --help' and for details about what those options mean, see the documentation for your new software.\n\n\n$ ./configure --prefix=/projects/community/gcc/7.3.0/gc563--with-  \nmpc=/projects/community/mpc/1.1.0/gc563 --with-\nmpfr=/projects/community/mpfr/4.0.1/gc563 --with-\ngmp=/projects/community/6.1.2/gc563 --disable-multilib\n\n\n\n\nNext, the 'make' utility will be used to compile your software. It requires the file named 'Makefile' that you created with the configure step. The Makefile indicates the sequence that an options to be used for building various components of your new software. The Makefile uses labels (i.e., names for different sections of the procedures contained therein), so entire sections of the Makefile can be skipped or used in a particular order. Running 'make' to compile your code can take a long time for some packages. You can parallelize this step to some extent using the '-j [n]' option where n is the number of tasks you wish to run simultaneously. This isn't quite the same as running a parallel or multithreaded program, but it can help get a large number of compiling tasks done in a shorter time.\n\n\nmake -j 8\n  \n\n\nFinally, I need to copy my newly created executables and/or libraries to their final destinations (the location I specified with '--prefix=' in the configure step, above). One of the labels present in the Makefile is named 'install' and I can instruct make to run the commands under that label as follows:\n\n\n make install\n cd .. ; rm -rf gcc-7.3.0*\n\n\n\n\nModulefiles for Community-Contributed Packages\n\n\nAll contributed software packages MUST have an associated \nLmod modulefile\n so users can easily access the software.\n\n\nDirectory structure for modulefiles (omit parts that aren't used, like /CUDA/version or /mpi-name/version):\n\n\n/projects/community/modulefiles/compiler-name/version/mpi-name/version/CUDA/version/pkg-name/version/NetID\n\n\nHere's an example Lmod modulefile for the GCC-7.3.0 example (above):\n\n\nhelp(\n[[\nThis module loads the GNU Compiler Collection version 7.3.0. \nThe GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Fortran, as well as libraries for these languages.\n]])\n\nwhatis(\"Description: GCC: the GNU Compiler Collection\")\nwhatis(\"URL: https://gcc.gnu.org\")\n\nconflict(\"gcc\")\n\nload(\"gmp/6.1.2-gc563\")\nload(\"mpfr/4.0.1-gc563\")\nload(\"mpc/1.1.0-gc563\")\n\nlocal base = pathJoin(\"/projects/community\", myModuleName(), \"7.3.0\", \"gc563\")\nprepend_path(\"PATH\", pathJoin(base, \"bin\"))\nprepend_path(\"C_INCLUDE_PATH\", pathJoin(base, \"include\"))\nprepend_path(\"CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\", pathJoin(base, \"include\"))\nprepend_path(\"LIBRARY_PATH\", pathJoin(base, \"lib64\"))\nprepend_path(\"LD_LIBRARY_PATH\", pathJoin(base, \"lib64\"))\nprepend_path(\"MANPATH\", pathJoin(base, \"share/man\"))\n\n\n\n\nOnce created, this file should be named \"7.3.0-gc563.lua\" because that's the name that will appear in the list of modules when a user runs the 'module avail' or 'module spider' command.\n\n\nUnderstanding this file:\n\n\nA 'conflict' can be specified to prevent loading a potentially conflicting module (e.g., loading 2 different versions of GCC at the same time)\n\n\nIn this example, 3 prerequisite modules are automatically loaded when this GCC module is loaded. Alternatively, you can simply specify a prerequisite using 'prereq(\"module/version\")' to notify a user of a prerequisite without automatically trying to load it.\n\n\nThe 'local base' statement establishes the general path for your software's various subdirectories\n\n\nThe 'prepend_path' statements define the specific path additions for those subdirectories",

I'll begin by \"bootstrapping\" using the core/default tools that come with the version of CentOS installed on Amarel. That version (at the time of this writing) is  $ cat /etc/*release | head -n 1\nCentOS Linux release 7.4.1708 (Core)  plus the additional components and tools that come from the Enterprise Linux repository. This version of CentOS is based on the following kernel and GCC version:  $ cat /proc/version\nLinux version 3.10.0-693.21.1.el7.x86_64 (builder@kbuilder.dev.centos.org) (gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16) (GCC) ) #1 SMP Wed Mar 7 19:03:37 UTC 2018  Installing GCC requires a few prerequisite packages: these must be installed and configured for use before installing GCC. Those prerequisites are: GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP) version 4.3.2 (or later) MPFR Library version 2.4.2 (or later) MPC Library version 0.8.1 (or later) I'll download, test, and install a recent version of each of these software packages. Since I'm just trying to get setup for installing GCC here, I'll skip the description of these steps because I'll discuss those steps in detail later (below).  wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.bz2\ntar -jxf gmp-6.1.2.tar.bz2\n./configure --prefix=/projects/community/gmp/6.1.2/gc563 --enable-cxx --enable-fft\nmake -j 4\nmake check\nmake install\ncd .. ; rm -rf gmp-6.1.2*  Note:  the following environment settings are needed for installing the next package.

I'll download the latest stable supported release of GCC, open the tarball, and get ready to install it:  wget http://mirrors.concertpass.com/gcc/releases/gcc-7.3.0/gcc-7.3.0.tar.gz\ntar -zxf gcc-7.3.0.tar.gz\ncd gcc-7.3.0  Like the 3 prerequisite software packages I just installed, the GCC compiler suite uses the traditional configure/make/make-install installation procedure. The first step is to run the Bash script named 'configure'. The configure script inspects the existing hardware and/or software configuration of the machine where you are about to install this new software. If something is needed and missing (e.g., a needed library or access to specific tools), the configure script should let you know. The result of running this script is the creation of a file named 'Makefile' that contains the instructions for compiling your new software based on the findings from the configure script. In addition, when you run the configure script, you have the opportunity to select important options for how your new software will be setup. Most importantly, you can select where the software will be installed. This is accomplished using the '--prefix=[some location]' option. In my case, I'll specify a location in my /home directory. There are many other options and those options vary depending on what you're installing. To see a summary of the available options, use './configure --help' and for details about what those options mean, see the documentation for your new software.  $ ./configure --prefix=/projects/community/gcc/7.3.0/gc563--with-  \nmpc=/projects/community/mpc/1.1.0/gc563 --with-\nmpfr=/projects/community/mpfr/4.0.1/gc563 --with-\ngmp=/projects/community/6.1.2/gc563 --disable-multilib  Next, the 'make' utility will be used to compile your software. It requires the file named 'Makefile' that you created with the configure step. The Makefile indicates the sequence that an options to be used for building various components of your new software. The Makefile uses labels (i.e., names for different sections of the procedures contained therein), so entire sections of the Makefile can be skipped or used in a particular order. Running 'make' to compile your code can take a long time for some packages. You can parallelize this step to some extent using the '-j [n]' option where n is the number of tasks you wish to run simultaneously. This isn't quite the same as running a parallel or multithreaded program, but it can help get a large number of compiling tasks done in a shorter time.  make -j 8     Finally, I need to copy my newly created executables and/or libraries to their final destinations (the location I specified with '--prefix=' in the configure step, above). One of the labels present in the Makefile is named 'install' and I can instruct make to run the commands under that label as follows:   make install\n cd .. ; rm -rf gcc-7.3.0*",

Where is it? \n\n\nThe filesystem has been moved to new hardware. As a result, what used to be \n/scratch\n before the upgrade is now \n/oldscratch\n. Please copy any files you need to retain to new /scratch. \n/oldscratch\n will be retired soon. \n\n\n I get a message telling me someone may be spoofing, when I try to login to Perceval. Am I in danger? \n\n\nYou are not in danger. During the upgrade the fingerprint of the server changed. Go to your \n.ssh/authorized_hosts\n or \n.ssh/known_hosts\n file and delete the line containing perceval information. The message you got before, that looked like the following, will disappear next time you login. \n\n\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n@       WARNING: POSSIBLE DNS SPOOFING DETECTED!          @\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nThe ECDSA host key for perceval.hpc.rutgers.edu has changed,\nand the key for the corresponding IP address 172.16.94.50\nis unknown.

After the upgrade the \n.snapshots\n was not copied. New \n/home/.snapshots\n will be created as soon as the backups kick in - at latest on Oct 20, but more likely midweek ~ Oct 18. Meanwhile the current version of snapshots as 10/09/2018 is available with a manual assistance  from OARC team on request.\n\n\nUsual FAQs\n\n\nEmailing for help\n\n\nwho do I email for help?\n\n\nPlease email \nhelp@oarc.rutgers.edu\n - this will reach all research scientists, but not system admins. Research scientists will include sysadmins if necessary. (We are trying to streamline communications.)\n\n\nerror and output files\n\n\nIn the directory \"slurm.slepner009.3695956.err\" was created. Is this what should be happening?\n \n\nYes, if one of your options to run a slurm job included a line like \n--error=slurm.%N.%j.err\n then any error messages during execution will be going to a file you can inspect afterwards to\ndetermine how to fix the job's failure. E.g. if your jobs's results are supposed to go to \nresults\n directory, but the directory \"results\" was not created before running the job. Since the slurm script is accessing a nonexistent path, it aborts. You can't see the job with \nsqueue\n because it's not running (it finished with \"exit 1\" i.e. failed). You can use the command \nsacct\n (see slurm cheatsheet) to see some details of finished jobs (but not as many details as with \nscontrol show job 12345\n). \n\n\ncommon errors and their fixes\n\n\nI'm getting this error. Why? What's happening?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerror\n\n\nexplanation\n\n\nfix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsbatch: error: Slurm temporarily unable to accept job, sleeping and retrying.\n\n\nThe Slurm queue reached its maximum and is not accepting new jobs\n\n\nWait until the queue clears up and resubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatch script contains DOS line breaks (\\r\\n)sbatch: error: instead of expected UNIX line breaks (\\n).\n\n\nIf you created or edited the file in Windows, it can insert Windows line breaks, which are not the same as unix line breaks.\n\n\nconvert between the two formats with \ndos2unix\n and \nunix2dos\n commands  - see \nthis explanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo such file or directory\n\n\nA path you gave is wrong or nonexistent\n\n\nCheck the exact path; if file exists, check permissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumpy and other hidden modules\n\n\nHow do I get numpy?\n\n\nYou need to load libraries that are needed by numpy first. For example Intel Math Kernel Library: \n\n\nmodule load intel_mkl/17.0.2 python/3.5.2 \n\n\n\n\nR DLLpath\n\n\n\n\nWhen I install R package xxx, I get an error  dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):\n \n\n\n\n\nA lot of R packages are actually written in other languages, very often C or C++. Depending on how the R package is packaged, it can rely on \"shared objects\", recognized by .so extension. These .so files are \ncreated by compilers, but different compiler versions will produce files which are sometimes not compatible. So either the .so is not found because its file path is missing, or it has been compiled for a \ndifferent version of the operating system or different version of the software. Complicating this, sometimes software which is in your path (e.g. anaconda will put itself in your .bashrc so it will be \navailable) has its own version of the library you want to load - e.g. R package may need a .so file that anaconda installation already contains, but is not compatible with your R package. Solutions can vary: \n\n\n\n\nremove paths to known other softeware (such as Anaconda)\n\n\nremove other R packages that might be interfering (e.g. by moving it out of your path, not necessarily deleting)\n\n\n\n\nemail notifications\n\n\nHow do I make sure that I get an email when my slurm job finally starts, finishes, or fails?\n\n\nIt is possible to specify in the slurm batch script or srun command that you wish to receive an email notification. There are two options associated with this: \n\nmail-type\n and \nmail-user\n. For example, \n--mail-type=BEGIN\n and \n--mail-user=kp807@rutgers.edu\n . \n\n\n\n\nWithout mail-type specified, it doesn't send an email \n\n\nIf you have domain other than \nrutgers.edu\n, slurm doesn't properly send it (e.g. \nkp807@oarc.rutgers.edu\n won't work, but \nkp807@rutgers.edu\n will.)\n\n\n\n\nOther options for \nmail-type\n are: BEGIN (send email when job starts, useful for interactive jobs), END (send email when job finishes), FAIL (send email when job finishes), ALL(send email for all 3). \n\n\nfile permissions\n\n\nOne way to control the access to the dataset is via \ngetfacl\n and \nsetfacl\n commands (see https://www.computerhope.com/unix/usetfacl.htm). Here is an example of how to give permission to user user1, and only\nto this user, to read one of my subdirectories, \nsharedir\n: \n\n\nsetfacl -m u:user1:rx /home/kp807/sharedir\n\n\n\n\nHere is how you would see what are the permissions to this directory: \n\n\ngetfacl  /home/kp807/sharedir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-m\n option means modify permissions\n\n\nu\n  means user\n\n\nrx\n means read and execute. You must give execute permissions to a directory if you want to execute a listing of the directory. You also have to give \nx\n permission to every directory that needs to be\ntraversed during execution and reading. E.g. you'd also have to execute \nsetfacl -m u:user1:x /home/kp807/\n\n\n\n\nNOTE OF CAUTION: By default, Linux umask is set to 022. This means that by default, all directories and files are readable by group and other. The only thing stopping someone else reading your home directory\nis lack of \nx\n flag on the home directory. If you add this flag to a user, now this user will also be able to read any readable files in your home directory. So use \nx\n flag judiciously, or simply change\nall your permissions (and user's \numask\n in \n.bashrc\n to something more restrictive). \n\n\npython and conda\n\n\nBackgroud:\n\n\n\n\nbash has some predefined variables that programs (or you) can use. You can get a list of those variables by typing \nenv\n command in your bash terminal. By convention, the names are uppercase.\n\n\nto set variables and get variables use \n=\n (without spaces) and \necho\n with \n${NAME_OF_VARIABLE}\n. E.g. \nPWD=/home/kris\n to set the \nPWD\n variable, or \necho $PATH\n to print the value of variable \nPATH\n\n\nPATH\n is a bash variable that tells the systems in which directories to look for the programs/commands you invoke from the bash terminal. You can see the current path by \necho $PATH\n\n\n.bashrc file is the file that always gets called when you start up a terminal, and sets PATH variable to some default\n\n\n\n\nHow to install anaconda with python 2, but not set it as default anaconda version\n\n\n\n\ninstall anaconda2 (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) - follow instructions for your OS\n\n\nanaconda puts itself automatically in your .bashrc file. You need to find the line that anaconda added and comment it out or delete from your .bashrc file so that anaconda2 is not your default every time you log in. The lines to comment out look like this: \n\n\n\n\n# added by Anaconda2 installer\nexport PATH=\"/home/kris/anaconda2/bin:$PATH\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you want to use anaconda2 instead of anaconda3, you reset your PATH variable manually, by issuing this command in your bash terminal:\n\nexport PATH=\"/home/$USER/anaconda2/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin\"\n\nThis will be valid ONLY in that terminal, so remember to launch any python2 scripts in that terminal, otherwise python will default to your other default\n\n\nVerify which conda and python version are you using by this command: \nwhich python\n\n\nWhen you are sure that you are using conda from anaconda2, create new conda environment with a descriptive name, e.g.\n\nconda create --name mytensorflow-1.5\n\n\nActivate this environment:\n\nsource activate mytensorflow-1.5\n\n\nInstall tensorflow-1.5 into this environment:\n\npip install tensorflow==1.5.0\n\n\nAfter having finished your work, \nsource deactivate\n gets you out of the mytensorflow-1.5 environment.\n\n\n\n\nNow you have installed your environment. Next time, these are the commands to get you in the python2, mytensorflow-1.5 environment ready to do your python2 work:\n\n\nexport PATH=\"/home/$USER/anaconda2/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin\"\nsource activate mytensorflow-1.5",
