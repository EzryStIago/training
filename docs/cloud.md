# Introduction

This page explains how to apply for Google Resarch and Education Credits correctly, and in the process minimize pain for you and for us and OIT. 

## Google credits for Education

This is to enable you to run courses or workshops in the cloud. 

- you do not need to provide a charging string or a credit card number
- your students will get a coupon to redeem
- if you go over allotted resources, the project access shuts down automatically

## Google credits for Research


- after you have been awarded credits, you will need a rutgers gcp account, such as kp807@gcp.rutgers.edu. To apply for the account, please fill out the form here: https://oit.rutgers.edu/request-gcp-rutgers-edu-account
- you will also need to request an environment: https://oitforms.rutgers.edu/request-cloud-environment
