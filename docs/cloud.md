# Introduction

This page explains how to apply for Google Resarch and Education Credits correctly, and in the process minimize pain for you and for us and OIT. 

## Google credits for Education

This is to enable you to run courses or workshops in the cloud. 

- you do not need to provide a charging string or a credit card number
- your students will get a coupon to redeem
- if you go over allotted resources, the project access shuts down automatically

 -PhD students and above can apply  
- 6 months project (they will be extending it to a year based on feedback they got)
- mean time to hear back to be approved - 2 weeks
