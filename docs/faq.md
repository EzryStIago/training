- **In the directory "slurm.slepner009.3695956.err" was created. Is this what should be happening?**   
Yes, if one of your options to run a slurm job included a line like `--error=slurm.%N.%j.err` then any error messages during execution will be going to a file you can inspect afterwards to
determine how to fix the job's failure. E.g. if your jobs's results are supposed to go to `results` directory, but the directory "results" was not created before running the job. Since the slurm script is accessing a nonexistent path, it aborts. You can't see the job with `squeue` because it's not running (it finished with "exit 1" i.e. failed). You can use the command `sacct` (see slurm cheatsheet) to see some details of finished jobs (but not as many details as with `scontrol show job 12345`).
