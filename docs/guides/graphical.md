# Transition from sirius

On Feb 25, 2019, sirius machine was retired. This section documents information for users who are transitionining from sirius to Amarel. 

## Similarities

- most of the same software is available as on the sirius machine - and many more. If there is a special program you use, and it is not available, it may be installed upon request. 
- to see what software is there, try `module use /projects/community/modulefiles` and `module avail` (as on sirius). A comparison is provided in the last section
- similar graphical interface based on the Linux desktop is available as the interface to the cluster

## Differences

- sirius3 is not a single isolated machine - it is one "compute" node on the computer cluster of some 400+ machines
- there is a scheduler called slurm, which makes sharing of the resources fairer between users - making it impossible to monopolize resources
- sirius3 is intended to be used for graphical applications and for interactive code development. As such, code for more intense computations may be developed and tested on small scale on this machine. However, to perform a more intense computation, you should prepare a "batch" script (see cluster guide and video walktroughs for OpenOnDemand job templates). To ensure that there are enough resources for many users at once, each user on sirius3 is **limited to 2 cores and 4Gb of memory for a maximum of 24 hours**. 
- you can submit sbatch jobs, from the sirius3 desktop, to the wider Amarel cluster

## Video walkthroughs

We have prepared some videos to illustrate the functionalities of OpenOnDemand graphical interface to the Amarel cluster: 

- TODO:  lauching Sirius3 desktop
- https://youtu.be/GPpDG1eAiKo - 4:24 mins - Amarel ondemand intro - available functionalities
- https://youtu.be/zNrpS5CUa-8 - 4:24 mins - launching Amarel desktop
- https://youtu.be/znmnbli0d5Y - 6:33 mins - using the Job Composer to keep track of slurm jobs, create new slurm jobs from templates, and create new templates.

## FastX users

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: When you login through FastX on Amarel, you are on the "login" node. This is a shared machine between tens of users at a time. It is essential that you don't run any intensive computations on this machine (like you did on sirius). Instead, you need to either ssh to sirius3, or submit a computational job through slurm (the scheduler). 

TODO: rest - how to connect from login node to sirius3.
