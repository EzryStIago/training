Welcome to the Office of Advanced Research Computing at Rutgers! 

> OARC is a university-wide initiative that aims to develop and implement a strategic vision for centralizing the advanced research computing and data cyberinfrastructure (ACI) ecosystem at Rutgers. OARC has the goal of providing Rutgers researchers with essential computing and data handling capabilities, and students with necessary exposure and training, through centralized resources, services and training.

For more information on OARC, including how to get access or become owners, please visit [our web page](https://oarc.rutgers.edu/)

These pages are a collection of resources to help you to utilize the cluster more effectively. Even if you are a very experienced Linux user, you will want to read [Amarel user guide]() as it has slurm tips and examples. 

# WARNING - READ!

- Do not run large computational jobs on the **login** node. Use slurm to allocate resources on the compute node. 
- TODO: add more complete list

## Learning paths

- For users familiar with Linux but new to `slurm`, follow [this path]()
- For users not familiar with Linux, please familiarize yourself with Linux through tutorials and cheatsheets
