This is a list of software already available on the cluster and the command you need to execute to load it in your environment:

# Setup

## Connect to the cluster login node 
Do this by one of the following methods: 

  - *via a terminal*: if you have a Mac or Linux, terminal is part of your standard apps. If you have Windows, install an SSH client such as `putty` or `moba-xterm`. Then from your terminal connect to the cluster by executing the following command: 

``` ssh -X <your net id>@amarel.hpc.rutgers.edu```

   This is the preferred way, as your copy-pasting will most likely work best. 
  - *via FastX*: in your browser, go to `https://amarel.hpc.rutgers.edu:3443`

## Get resources on the compute node 

You get to the cluster to execute your computations by running the following command in your terminal: 

```srun  -p main --reservation=genomics -N 1 -c 2 -n 1 -t 01:40:00 --export=ALL --pty /bin/bash```

Notice that the name in your terminal will change from `amarel` to node name like `hal0025` or `slepner086`. This means that you will not impede other users who are also using the login node, and will be placed on a machine which you share with only a few people. This explains the parts of this command: 

|command part| meaning|
|----|----|
|`srun`| `slurm` run, i.e. allocate resources and run via `slurm` scheduler | 
|`-p main` | on the main partition, one of several queues on the cluster|
|`--reservation=genomics`| we reserved some compute nodes for this workshop to not wait long for resources|
|`-N 1`| ask for one node|
|`-c 2`| ask for two cores|
|`-n 1`| this will be 1 most times|
|`-t 01:40:00`| run this for a maximum time of 1 hour 40 minutes|
|`--pty /bin/bash`| run the terminal shell in an interactive mode|

## Prepare some directories for the data

   You have two main spaces on the Amarel cluster. These are `/home/netid/` (e.g. `/home/kp807/` for my netid) and '/scratch/netid/'. They differ in how often they are backed up and by size (100Gb for `/home` and 500Gb for `/scratch`). So we will install programs in `/home`, while the data and output will be in `/scratch`. Execute these commands: 
```
                cd ~                      # change directory to your home directory
                mkdir Genomics_Workshop
                cd Genomics_Workshop
                mkdir Programs            # download and install programs here
```

```
                mkdir -p  /scratch/$USER/Genomics_Workshop/
                cd /scratch/$USER/Genomics_Workshop/
                mkdir untreated  
                mkdir dex_treated
```

## Install programs

   Each program will have slightly different installation instructions. Here is a handy sequence of commands that will install them: 
```
##We are going to do some modifications to a system file .bashrc, be careful doing it and make sure that you created a copy of your .bashrc file
                cd
                cp .bashrc .bashrc_20180118
                nano .bashrc
##At the end of the file add the line  “##  Genomics_Workshop 06/27/2018 settings”
##Exit nano (ctrl+x)

#Seqtk:   https://github.com/lh3/seqtk   ##  very handy and fast for processing fastq/a files

                cd Genomics_Workshop/Programs/

                cd seqtk
                make
                echo ‘export PATH=$HOME/Genomics_Workshop/Programs/seqtk:$PATH’ >>  ~/.bashrc

                wget http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/2.8.2/sratoolkit.2.8.2-centos_linux64.tar.gz
                tar zxvf sratoolkit.2.8.2-centos_linux64.tar.gz
                echo ‘export PATH=$HOME/Genomics_Workshop/Programs/sratoolkit.2.8.2-centos_linux64/bin:$PATH’ >> ~/.bashrc

                unzip  fastqc_v0.11.6.zip
                echo ‘export PATH=$HOME/Genomics_Workshop/Programs/FastQC:$PATH’ >> ~/.bashrc
                source ~/.bashrc

```
Moreover, execute these commands to load system-installed sofware so the system knows where to find it (i.e. `samtools command will work`): 
```
module load samtools       
module load bedtools2./2.25.0
module load bowtie2
module load mvapich2/2.1  boost/1.59.0  tophat2/2.1.0
module load intel/17.0.4 R-Project/3.4.1
```
