# Bash cheatsheet (command line): 

|command | description | usage example |
|:-----------|:--------|:-------------|
|ls -ltra mydir| list all files in mydir in descending order of creation, with permissions | ls -ltra .|
|du | disk usage, e.g. how much space does your directory occupy, -h human-readable | du -h mydir|
|which <command>| see where command is installed | which python|
|pwd| which directory I'm in | pwd |
|man <command>| manual page for command | man cut|
|grep <pattern>| filter for lines which fit pattern | cat myfile &#124; grep GATK |
|cut -d<delimiter> -f<number>| split line by delimiter and get field number 3| cat myfile &#124; cut -d'_' -f3 |
|sort <file>| sort lines, often used with `uniq` | sort myfile &#124; uniq |
|uniq| suppress repeated lines, works only if sorted | see above example |
|less | paginated output | less myfile |
| >| redirect output (e.g. list files and save filenames in aaa.txt) | ls > aaa.txt |
|>>| append output to existing file | echo "blah" >> aaa.txt |
| find| find files with some properties e.g. display all files recursively from current directory| `find .`|

|top| display most intensive processes | `top`|
|ps auxw| list processes | `ps auxw` |
|time myscript.sh| measure how much time does myscript.sh take to finish execution

Here is a sample: 
```
dirname /home/kp807/projects/cluster_reports/cluster.csv       # everything but the last part
basename /home/kp807/projects/cluster_reports/cluster.csv      # last part of path
CURRENT_DIR=`pwd` ; echo $CURRENT_DIR                          # backtick for execution of bash command
echo 'projects_cluster_file.csv' | cut -d '_' -f1              # split name to retain a part of file
echo $((1 + 2))                                                # double parenthesis for arithmetic expressions
echo filename_fly{5..10}.csv                                   # list comprehensions   {start..end}

# for-loop: 
for file in filename_fly{5..10}.csv; do  echo $file ; done     

# if-statement - 2 examples
if [ 1 -gt 2 ]; then  echo '1 > 2' ; else echo '1<2' ; fi      
if [ -d "newdir" ]; then  echo 'directory exists' ; else echo 'this directory doesnt exist' ; fi                        
#variable assignment
a=10; echo $a        #good - no spaces
